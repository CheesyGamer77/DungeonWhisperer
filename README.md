# DungeonWhisperer

DungeonWhisperer was a private, community-facing bot built for the official Minecraft Dungeons Discord Server (https://discord.gg/minecraftdungeons). It was developed by me with huge help from Raybeano99, Matt Gartzke, and the rest of the Minecraft Dungeons Discord Moderation Team.

## Features

DungeonWhisperer handled cosmetic role assignments and embed utilities for the moderators of the Minecraft Dungeons Discord. Development took place from December 2020 through December 2021; when I left my position as a moderator.

DungeonWhisperer was among one of the first bots to embrace and utilize Buttons and Select Menu message components.
Reactions for these interaction events were handled via the "Actions" framework that I developed for this project. "Actions" are stored as a JSON schema detailing how the bot should respond given a particular component interaction event. These schemas are stored as a database entry containing information about the component the Action should apply to.

## Discontinuation of Service

This bot is no longer online, but nevertheless I'm pleased to showcase this project of mine that I've spent a significant ammount of my free time on.

**Please do not self host an instance of DungeonWhisperer.** This repository only serves to be a showcase of this past project of mine. I will not be providing support for those wishing to self host.
